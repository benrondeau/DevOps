Personal DevOps Notes for Ideal Process


### Raw Notes
- Code management with Git (duh)
- Issue tracking
- PRs
- Release/build tagging
- Continuous integration
- Templates for issues, PRs
- Joel test
- Single build script for everything
- Project management (Zenhub or the like)
- Proper API documentation, like [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)
- Code documentation (lots of source code, not text) in README, Wiki or with a tool like [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
- Document process for all this, not just how individual steps/components work

Code
- Linting of styles, scripts
- Testing, both automated and manual (each PR should list any manual QA testing steps)
- Simplicity of complexity
- Progressive Web Apps
- Cross browser testing for scripts
- Testing on real devices
